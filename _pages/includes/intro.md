Previously, I was an AI researcher at FPT Software AI Center Lab, working with [Prof. Anh Nguyen](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~anguyen/). In 2021, I received my **honors bachelor's degree** in computer science from the University of Information Technology-Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM), where I was supervised by [Prof. Le Dinh Duy](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=6lbtgt4AAAAJ&hl=en). (**Honors programs** offer special curricula, privileges, scholarships, and recognition for exceptional undergraduate students)

I have multiple years of experience working in the industry as an AI Research Engineer at renowned AI companies in Vietnam, including MoMo M-Service JSC (a unicorn), FPT Software, and VinBrain (Acquired by NVIDIA).

My research focuses on **Embodied AI**, an interdisciplinary field integrating robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing. I aim to enable robots to achieve human-level manipulation capabilities through large-scale data and real-world interaction. I am particularly interested in foundation models and world models—such as vision-language-action models, multimodal learning, and domain generalization—and their applications in robotics, computer vision, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and medical imaging.
